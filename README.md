# Mongodb k8s

Helping new hires to understand k8s with MongoDB example.
Full description of steps is under the company's property :) 

## k8s Notes

### Basic Mongodb deployment process

* Need to generate secret before pointing on it in the mongo deployment configuration
* `kubectl apply -f ./k8s/mongodb/mongo-secret.yml`

* Need to apply the deployment cfg (includes the service as well. In k8s they go together usually)
* `kubectl apply -f ./k8s/mongodb/mongo.yml`

* Check that mongo-service is running
* `kubectl describe service mongodb-service`

### Adding deployment for mongo-express for admin UI

* Need to add configMap that will enable the mongo-express service to find the database url
* `kubectl apply -f ./k8s/mongodb/mongo-configmap.yml`

* Then you can run the mongo-express deployment
* `kubectl apply -f ./k8s/mongodb/mongo-express.yml`
